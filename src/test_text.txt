And in January of this year, to put this in the perspective I have on it, I was teaching a course to MIT and Harvard undergraduates in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, called "Evolution of an Epidemic." And this is a course that uses HIV as a model to try and understand how an epidemic emerges, how clues from patients guide scientific discovery, and how policy and advocacy influence the course of an epidemic. Now, as chance would have it, one of the things that we did was we were visiting traditional healers. And as chance would have it, one of the people in the course was an MIT student who had just returned from Wuhan, and another was the Director of Emerging Pathogens for Gilead, a former trainee of mine who I'd invited along as one of the speakers. The student from Wuhan started getting text messages multiple times a day from her family, talking about what a desperate situation it was there related to this new pneumonia that was emerging. And Diana Brainard, the person from Gilead, was getting phone calls every day from physicians in China, asking her to release a drug that they had developed for Ebola, called Remdesivir, so that they could try it to see if it had any effect on this new, deadly pathogen. It became clear to me from those conversations that this had the potential to be a big problem. As Rick said, I'm the director of the Ragon Institute. Our mission is to harness the immune system to prevent and cure human disease with a focus on infectious pathogens of global importance, and our strategy is really to use cross-disciplinary collaboration, coupled with flexible funding, to try and make advances. And we're fortunate to be embedded in, I think, one of the best biomedical research ecosystems anywhere. So we started working on this, really, right away, and what I would like to do now, as the first speaker, is to give you a bit of an overview of what we know. How did this pandemic start? How does it cause disease, the virus, SARS-CoV-2? What are the prospects for treatment? And what are the prospects for vaccines? So getting right into this, let's put it in the perspective of what we experienced with HIV. So HIV was recognized in 1981, but the infection started being transmitted in the US at least as early as in 1978 or even earlier. So in 1981, it was clear that something was going on. It was '83, two years later, before we knew what was causing this new disease, and it took two more years to develop a diagnostic test so we could know actually who had it. Now, let's compare what happened with this particular pandemic. So what happened was that patients started coming to hospitals in Wuhan with a pneumonia of unknown cause. And looking back at this, it was the end of December when this cluster of cases happened, and there was a really important observation made by health care workers. And that was that these people had a common experience of having been at a Hunan market, suggesting that this might be a transmissible agent. That led to the use of shotgun sequencing to identify the etiologic agent and to the development of a diagnostic test based on PCR. That all, which took four years for HIV, occurred in less than a month, so an extraordinary tribute to the advances that have been made in science over the years. The sequencing allowed scientists to recognize this as a beta coronavirus, which is an RNA virus that has a single strand of RNA and then an outer envelope with a predominant spike protein that's a major target for the immune response. The origin of the virus is almost certainly from bats, originally. It also is very closely related to a coronavirus that's been identified from pangolins, but, likely, the transmission went from bat to pangolin, back to bat, and then to humans, although the epidemiology is still not certain on that score. This is not the first pathogenic human coronavirus that we've seen. SARS, in 2003, caused a total of 8,000 cases with a fatality rate of 11%, but, thankfully, the transmissibility of SARS was not that high. MERS came along in 2011 and still persists. There've been 2,500 some cases with a much higher case fatality rate of 34%, but, again, thankfully, low transmissibility. But look at the contrast to SARS-CoV-2. We now have over 25 million cases as of this morning. The estimated fatality rate is somewhere between 1/2% and 1%. That varies widely depending upon the age group and the geography, and it's very transmissible. I think the important thing for everybody to recognize from this slide is that we can expect to have additional coronaviruses in our future, and the big fear, and I think what's an existential threat to humanity, is the possibility of a coronavirus with the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the case fatality rate of MERS. So it really does behoove us to monitor for these emerging pathogens. Why is it that SARS-CoV-2 has spread so effectively? Well, it's in large part because the transmissibility begins before the onset of symptoms. And, in fact, this is very different than MERS and SARS, which only are at peak transmissibility a number of days after onset of symptoms. This makes it very hard to do case tracking and isolation of infectious individuals. Not surprisingly, we have a huge pandemic, 25 million global cases, 850,000 deaths, and over 6 million infections in the US, which is the most affected country in the world. So how is it that SARS-CoV-2 causes disease? I'd like, because of the diverse audience, to start out with just a basic concept of understanding what's the difference between a virus and a bacterium. Looking here at E. coli compared in size to SARS-CoV-2, I've exaggerated the size of the virus here compared to the bacterium, but there are significant differences between these two. E. coli has over 4,000 genes.
