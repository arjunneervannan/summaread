RICHARD YOUNG: Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.970
We're about nine months
into the COVID pandemic.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.370
In that time, a remarkable
amount of information

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.010
has been learned about
the novel coronavirus

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.400
and about host cell biology,
immunology, epidemiology,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.340
and clinical disease.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.120
There are complexities
in these subjects

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.060
that confound even the experts.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.550
The purpose of this
course is to learn

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.700
what we know about
these subjects

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.330
from the world's top scientists.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.420
I'm Richard Young, and together
with for Facundo Batista

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.740
and our teaching
assistant Lena Afeyan,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.620
we are core faculty for
MIT's course 700 on COVID-19,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.830
SARS-CoV-2, and the pandemic.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.960
I'm going to make a few
remarks to the students who

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.690
are registered for this
course and then introduce

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.460
our first speaker.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.040
Students, if you miss any of
the following instructions,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.250
you can find them in the
course's Canvas site.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.200
First, live
attendance of lectures

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.690
is encouraged but not required.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.610
Recordings of the
lectures will be posted

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.370
with a link on the Canvas site.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.660
Your TA, Lena, will post
an after-lecture prompt

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.370
as a survey on Canvas,
a response to which

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.650
will be required before the
start of the next week's

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.730
lecture.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.540
Answers will be graded
for participation,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.370
and students need to
participate in at least 90%

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.580
of these prompts
to pass the class.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.790
Lena will hold a session
Mondays from 1:00 to 2:00 PM,

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.150
except for holidays, reviewing
relevant basic material

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.840
to help you better understand
the next day's lecture.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.330
Recommended reading and
other reading materials

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.720
are posted on the Canvas
site and will be suggested

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.490
alongside the prompts.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.650
Students are encouraged,
but not required,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.300
to engage with these materials.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.030
Finally, during each
session, students

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.530
can submit questions via the
Q&amp;A function in Zoom Webinar.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.240
Selected questions
will be discussed

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.950
at the end of the
lecture, and students

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.890
are welcome to ask any
unanswered questions

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.800
during office hours.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.440
Our first speaker for this
course is Dr. Bruce Walker.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.880
Dr. Walker is a physician
scientist and immunologist,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.490
the founding director of the
Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.080
and Harvard, a Howard Hughes
Medical Institute professor,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.270
a professor of medicine
at Harvard Medical School,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.020
and a professor of the
practice of medicine at MIT.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.470
He is also adjunct professor of
medicine at the Nelson Mandela

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.010
School of Medicine at the
University of KwaZulu-Natal

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.170
in Durban, South
Africa, where he

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.020
has catalyzed the creation
of two important research

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.370
institutes.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.760
Dr. Walker is one of
my scientific heroes,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.000
a person who has played a major
role in addressing the AIDS

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.950
pandemic, and who now is helping
us address the COVID pandemic.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.900
Just last week, he
and his collaborators

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.330
published an important
story in Nature,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.400
showing that T cells
in some individuals

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.430
can apparently
cure HIV infection.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.460
Together with Arlene Sharpe,
he is the co-director

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.670
of the recently established
Massachusetts Consortium

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.430
on Pathogen Readiness,
a collaboration

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.720
among more than 500 local
scientists focused on COVID-19

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.570
research from Harvard,
MIT, BU, Tufts, UMass,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.780
and the academic teaching
hospitals in Boston.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.870
Bruce, thank you so much
for giving the first lecture

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.720
in our course.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.770
BRUCE WALKER: Well,
Rick, thanks very much.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.240
I'm delighted to do this.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.700
So as Rick indicated, I'm
a physician scientist.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.340
I graduated from medical school
in 1980, came to Mass General,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.310
intending to become
a family physician,

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.010
but then something
very odd happened,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.470
which was the emergence
of a new disease.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.840
None of us knew what it was.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.570
People that had it were
dying left and right.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.750
We had no treatments,
and it became clear to me

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.250
very quickly that if we
didn't, as physicians

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.980
on the front lines, learn
from our patients, then

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.750
we would watch a
lot of people die.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.560
So I then took the route of
both taking care of patients

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.520
and doing scientific
research, and I've

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.180
continued to work on
HIV my entire career.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.200
And in January of this year,
to put this in the perspective

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.320
I have on it, I was
teaching a course

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.300
to MIT and Harvard
undergraduates

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.510
in KwaZulu-Natal,
South Africa, called

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.840
"Evolution of an Epidemic."

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.350
And this is a
course that uses HIV

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.830
as a model to try and understand
how an epidemic emerges,

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.010
how clues from patients
guide scientific discovery,

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.350
and how policy and
advocacy influence

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.420
the course of an epidemic.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.868
Now, as chance
would have it, one

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:47.410
of the things that
we did was we were

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.310
visiting traditional healers.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.090
And as chance would have it,
one of the people in the course

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.720
was an MIT student who had
just returned from Wuhan,

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.530
and another was the Director of
Emerging Pathogens for Gilead,

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.410
a former trainee of mine
who I'd invited along

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.130
as one of the speakers.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.970
The student from Wuhan
started getting text messages

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.100
multiple times a
day from her family,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.220
talking about what a desperate
situation it was there

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.260
related to this new
pneumonia that was emerging.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.150
And Diana Brainard,
the person from Gilead,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.630
was getting phone calls every
day from physicians in China,

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.660
asking her to release a
drug that they had developed

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.500
for Ebola, called Remdesivir,
so that they could try it to see

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.990
if it had any effect on
this new, deadly pathogen.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.630
It became clear to me
from those conversations

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.830
that this had the potential
to be a big problem.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.080
As Rick said, I'm the director
of the Ragon Institute.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.060
Our mission is to
harness the immune system

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.760
to prevent and cure human
disease with a focus

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.790
on infectious pathogens
of global importance,

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.950
and our strategy
is really to use

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.280
cross-disciplinary
collaboration, coupled

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.710
with flexible funding,
to try and make advances.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.410
And we're fortunate to
be embedded in, I think,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.080
one of the best biomedical
research ecosystems anywhere.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.580
So we started working on
this, really, right away,

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.900
and what I would like to do
now, as the first speaker,

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.680
is to give you a bit of an
overview of what we know.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.720
How did this pandemic start?

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.830
How does it cause disease,
the virus, SARS-CoV-2?

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.810
What are the prospects
for treatment?

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.330
And what are the
prospects for vaccines?

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.060
So getting right into
this, let's put it

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.790
in the perspective of what
we experienced with HIV.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.730
So HIV was recognized in
1981, but the infection

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:48.430
started being transmitted in the
US at least as early as in 1978

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.240
or even earlier.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.500
So in 1981, it was clear
that something was going on.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.960
It was '83, two years
later, before we

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.450
knew what was causing
this new disease,

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.600
and it took two more years to
develop a diagnostic test so we

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.570
could know actually who had it.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.440
Now, let's compare what happened
with this particular pandemic.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.100
So what happened
was that patients

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.530
started coming to
hospitals in Wuhan

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.170
with a pneumonia
of unknown cause.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.560
And looking back at this,
it was the end of December

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.870
when this cluster
of cases happened,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.180
and there was a really
important observation

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.530
made by health care workers.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.940
And that was that these
people had a common experience

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:36.820
of having been at
a Hunan market,

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:42.040
suggesting that this might
be a transmissible agent.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.360
That led to the use
of shotgun sequencing

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.720
to identify the etiologic
agent and to the development

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.700
of a diagnostic
test based on PCR.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:58.440
That all, which took
four years for HIV,

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:03.450
occurred in less than a month,
so an extraordinary tribute

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.860
to the advances that have been
made in science over the years.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.110
The sequencing
allowed scientists

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.560
to recognize this as
a beta coronavirus,

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:20.430
which is an RNA virus that
has a single strand of RNA

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:26.430
and then an outer envelope with
a predominant spike protein

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:31.600
that's a major target
for the immune response.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.789
The origin of the virus
is almost certainly

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.740
from bats, originally.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.480
It also is very closely
related to a coronavirus

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.030
that's been identified
from pangolins,

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:49.110
but, likely, the transmission
went from bat to pangolin, back

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.720
to bat, and then to humans,
although the epidemiology

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.010
is still not certain
on that score.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.830
This is not the first
pathogenic human coronavirus

00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.610
that we've seen.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:03.600
SARS, in 2003, caused
a total of 8,000 cases

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.170
with a fatality rate of
11%, but, thankfully,

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.620
the transmissibility of
SARS was not that high.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.680
MERS came along in 2011
and still persists.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.870
There've been 2,500 some
cases with a much higher case

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.900
fatality rate of 34%,
but, again, thankfully,

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.790
low transmissibility.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.130
But look at the
contrast to SARS-CoV-2.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:31.150
We now have over 25 million
cases as of this morning.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.720
The estimated fatality rate is
somewhere between 1/2% and 1%.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.650
That varies widely
depending upon the age

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:43.690
group and the geography,
and it's very transmissible.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.430
I think the important
thing for everybody

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:50.620
to recognize from this
slide is that we can expect

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.220
to have additional
coronaviruses in our future,

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.470
and the big fear,
and I think what's

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.630
an existential
threat to humanity,

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.550
is the possibility
of a coronavirus

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:04.690
with the transmissibility
of SARS-CoV-2 and the case

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:07.330
fatality rate of MERS.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:12.400
So it really does behoove us
to monitor for these emerging

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.600
pathogens.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.250
Why is it that SARS-CoV-2
has spread so effectively?

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:25.690
Well, it's in large part because
the transmissibility begins

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.880
before the onset of symptoms.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.790
And, in fact, this is very
different than MERS and SARS,

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:35.020
which only are at
peak transmissibility

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.000
a number of days after
onset of symptoms.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.310
This makes it very hard to do
case tracking and isolation

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.340
of infectious individuals.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:52.000
Not surprisingly, we have
a huge pandemic, 25 million

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.550
global cases, 850,000 deaths,
and over 6 million infections

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:03.740
in the US, which is the most
affected country in the world.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.230
So how is it that
SARS-CoV-2 causes disease?

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.870
I'd like, because of
the diverse audience,

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.140
to start out with just a basic
concept of understanding what's

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.990
the difference between
a virus and a bacterium.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:22.000
Looking here at E. coli
compared in size to SARS-CoV-2,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.540
I've exaggerated the
size of the virus

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.850
here compared to the
bacterium, but there

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:32.290
are significant differences
between these two.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.920
E. coli has over 4,000 genes.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.440
It, like other bacteria,
is metabolically active,

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.130
and it's capable of
independent reproduction.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.290
SARS-CoV-2, on the
other hand, has

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.440
a total of 10 genes and
14 open reading frames.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.520
It's metabolically inert, and it
cannot reproduce independently.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.860
Instead, it depends
on the ability

00:11:53.860 --> 00:12:01.120
to infect the human host and
to commandeer the human host

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:07.200
to actually make the genes that
are normally making proteins

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.630
for the cell to use
for its own purposes,

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.480
to hijack that
and force the cell

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.260
to make viral proteins so
that the virus can replicate

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.170
and make new copies of itself.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:27.740
When the initial infections were
identified to be in the lungs,

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.380
that immediately
focused clinicians

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.180
on obtaining
specimens and trying

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.190
to find the etiologic
agent, which

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.900
is what happened through
sequencing of lung epithelial

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.380
cells, and that
also led to a search

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.340
for understanding how the virus
was actually gaining entry

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.510
into those cells.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.970
And that led to the
identification of ACE-2

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.058
as the receptor.

00:12:51.058 --> 00:12:52.850
There was a head start
on this because this

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.040
is the same receptor
that SARS uses,

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.080
the original SARS coronavirus.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.450
That is, however, not the--

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:05.280
those are not the only
cells that become infected.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.820
Goblet cells and ciliated
cells in the nose

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:14.330
are quite infectible, and
that actually, probably,

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.000
facilitates transmission.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.030
Lung pneumocytes are infectible.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.530
That's how we get pneumonia.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.220
The gut is also infectible,
resulting in diarrhea

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.560
in some individuals.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.530
The virus can also
infect endothelial cells

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.980
in the circulation,
and this leads to,

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.930
is thought to lead to, a
coagulopathy and clotting

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:40.310
that results in a great
amount of morbidity.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.460
Cardiac myocytes can
also express the receptor

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.880
for this coronavirus.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:52.010
And myocarditis has been another
disease that's been noted,

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:57.470
and it's even appears possible
that the central nervous system

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.250
cells can also be infected,
such as olfactory neurons.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.880
This infection doesn't happen
without the body taking notice,

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.640
and one of the ways
the body fights back

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.930
is that these B cells, one
arm of the immune response,

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:18.020
start to making antibodies,
which are proteins that

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.500
directly bind to the virus.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.170
They're generated in
response to the virus.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.550
They learn in lymph nodes how
to recognize it effectively,

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:32.000
and then they target
it and destroy it.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.760
If, however, cells get
infected, then another arm

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:39.530
of the immune system kicks
in, so-called killer cells,

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.810
or cytotoxic T cells.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:46.100
These recognize infected cells
because once a cell's infected,

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.400
it alerts the body to the fact
that something bad is going

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.270
on inside that cell by
presenting viral peptides

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.910
at the cell surface
in conjunction

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.760
with an HLA class I
molecule, a surface

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.330
receptor on these cells.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:06.730
Foreign peptide in the HLA
molecule in the binding groove

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.590
alerts these killer
cells to the fact

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.600
that something bad is going on.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.400
They recognize that and deliver
a lethal hit to the cell,

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:21.910
killing it, and thereby
eliminating infectious virus.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:25.300
So OK, so we have these
immune responses that

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.990
are being generated to
this virus the same way

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.730
that they are to other viruses.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.920
Why is it that they're
not doing a better job?

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.370
Well, it turns out that B
cell antibody production

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.710
is impaired, and
this is work that's

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:43.030
from Shiv Pallai, who will be
speaking later in this course,

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.420
where he noted through
autopsy studies

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.690
that, in fact, unlike a
normal immune response

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.210
that gets generated
within a lymph node,

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:56.860
where these germinal centers
result in antibody maturation

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.460
and affinity maturation that
allows recognition, what

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.780
happens in COVID-19 disease
is that these germinal centers

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.070
don't form.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:11.110
So there's an abnormal
immune response underway

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.340
that we're all attempting
to understand better.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.620
Let me introduce now a
second concept, and that

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.750
is to make sure
that we understand

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.690
the difference between
infection and inflammation.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.550
Infection is invasion of the
body by disease-causing agents,

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.060
their multiplication
in the body,

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.260
and then the reaction of host
tissues to that pathogen.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.030
Inflammation, on
the other hand, is

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.720
the body's process of fighting
against things that harm it,

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.900
such as infections, by releasing
chemicals, that are also

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.830
called cytokines, that call
the immune system into action

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.850
and recruit other cells.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:51.460
So a second reason
why the immune system

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.890
doesn't do a better
job is because it

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.880
appears that these killer cells
are ineffective at eliminating

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.390
infected cells, but they do
produce a lot of cytokines,

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.310
these chemical messengers.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.319
In the same way infected cells
release chemical messengers,

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.680
these then act on other
cells and activate them

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.280
to elicit even further
chemical messengers,

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.300
and all of this
immune activation

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:24.210
leads to bystander problems.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.339
And we see this
hyperimmune state,

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.980
which has been termed
an inflammatory storm,

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.660
or a cytokine storm.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.120
And here, looking
at a normal lung

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.720
on the left, you can see
that the alveolar air sacs,

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.270
which is where gas exchange
happens between taking

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.630
a breath in and getting
oxygen into the bloodstream,

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.690
you can see that those are
very fine membranes that

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.610
allow for ready passage.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:55.290
On the right, you see what
happens in COVID-19 disease.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.240
There's this
massive infiltration

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.310
of inflammatory cells, a marked
thickening of the septae,

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:06.880
and an impairment
of gas exchange,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:16.300
leading, then, to the clinical
problems with lung disease.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.210
Now, essentially,
what I've just told

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.670
you is that we have an
immune response that's

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:26.920
designed to basically generate
an antiviral immune response,

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.360
and that happens early on.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.740
But what we believe
happens in COVID-19 disease

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:37.660
is that that is actually
replaced by a host

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.200
inflammatory response that
actually, rather than acting

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.810
as friend, actually
acts more as foe

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.630
in the later stages
of disease as there's

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.690
increasing disease severity.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:55.210
We know that this disease does
not affect everybody equally,

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.600
probably not surprisingly
because the older people get,

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.060
the more likely they're
going to have comorbidities

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:06.280
that make them less resilient
to diseases in general.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.380
And in fact, what
was striking early on

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.930
was a sense that children
did not get infected,

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.810
but, sadly, that is not true.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:17.200
And in fact, in data that
just came out yesterday

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.710
from the American
Academy of Pediatrics,

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:24.610
there has been recently a
greater increase in cases,

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:29.170
hospitalizations, and deaths of
percentage increase in children

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.150
compared to the percentage
increase that we've

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.430
been seeing in adults.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:37.270
On top of that, there's a
unique inflammatory syndrome

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:40.630
that has been recognized
in children, which

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.270
is similar to Kawasaki
disease, which

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:47.710
is an inflammatory disease
of unclear etiology.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.570
But what you can
see on this slide

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:55.840
is that between 2015 and 2019,
before the advent of COVID-19

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.540
disease, there
were sporadic cases

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:04.130
of non-severe Kawasaki disease
and occasional severe cases.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.800
But look at what
happened in 2020.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.030
Suddenly, this enormous
spike in infections.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.100
We think that it's due
to a post-inflammatory,

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.750
a post-infectious
inflammatory response.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:19.990
What exactly causes it is still
being investigated, but is

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:23.470
of critical significance
related to vaccine

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:27.600
development for children.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.350
I'd like to say a few
words about diagnostics

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:36.710
now as a key component to
trying to curtail the pandemic.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:38.660
What you're probably
most familiar with

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.000
are RNA tests, which
is PCR, and this

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.670
is what's being done
through the Broad Institute

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:48.140
for all of the MIT and
Harvard undergraduates.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:53.180
These RNA tests use polymerase
chain reaction to amplify

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.510
fragments of a viral RNA.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:21:00.050
So they don't tell you
whether what's being amplified

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.790
is actually infectious or not.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:07.340
They just tell you that there
is viral genetic material there.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:11.510
And if you look, as was done
at Mass General Hospital,

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:18.680
at RNA detection rates following
admission to the hospital,

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:23.450
what you see is that the percent
of people that are admitted who

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.920
start out positive
declines over time,

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.350
but some people remain RNA
positive for four weeks

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.610
or more.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:33.560
The question is,
are these people

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.030
infectious all that time?

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:38.030
Because we're right now
using the RNA detection

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.900
assay as a yes-or-no assay.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.400
Well, it turns out that there's
declining infectiousness

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.040
over time to the point
that the CDC revamped

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:51.530
its definition of recovery
to mean 10 days after symptom

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:56.570
onset, and at least three days
of the absence of symptoms.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.590
It's really critical that we
develop an assay that we still

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:03.050
don't have that tells us--

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:06.920
that measures the
infectiousness of a person.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.760
Now, another diagnostic
test that's been developed

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.470
is called-- it's
a category called

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:14.660
antigen tests, where
you're not looking

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.130
for viral genetic material.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:19.010
You're looking for
viral proteins,

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.730
such as the membrane
proteins in blue

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.440
or the spike protein
in brown here.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.510
And the way that these
diagnostic tests are being done

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:33.410
is very much like the
point-of-care diagnostic test

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:39.380
that's used as a pregnancy
test, where what one does is put

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:46.670
a detection strip into urine,
in the case of a pregnancy test,

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:48.860
and in the case of--

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:52.610
hang on.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.280
And in the case of COVID-19,
what you would ideally use

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.920
is saliva or a
nasal swab, and then

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.990
use a swab that would
tell you whether or not

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:14.070
you're infected by having one
or two bands on this strip light

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.150
up.

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:18.510
These are now
actually available;

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.790
they're less sensitive.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:24.370
But, in fact, less sensitive
may actually be better.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.605
So let's just think about
the different assays I just

00:23:27.605 --> 00:23:28.230
told you about.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.570
The RNA-based tests are
much more expensive,

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.980
and they require, really,
much more extensive machinery,

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.080
although that also
is being addressed.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.890
Rapid antigen tests
are much cheaper.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.520
Sensitivity is lower,
but scale-up ability

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.290
is higher, easier to get
to underserved areas,

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:49.455
easier for frequent
testing, easier ease of use.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:54.570
But at least right now,
they're not quantitative.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.670
RNA tests can be
quantitative, but we

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:59.410
haven't used them
that way, and I

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:02.010
think there's a move
afoot to do that,

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:03.840
and there are supply
chain issues that

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.270
are predominantly
for the RNA tests,

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.180
but not so much for the
rapid antigen tests.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:13.200
So another important
diagnostic is

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.330
to figure out who's had
the infection already,

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:18.000
and this is done by testing
for antibodies, which

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.010
are proteins in the
blood that are generated

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.800
in response to infection.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.410
When somebody gets
infected, initially, there's

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:27.240
a wave of virus that occurs.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.960
The immune response responds
by generating antibodies,

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.080
and, ideally, these
antibodies then,

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.840
after the infection's
cleared, come down to a level

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.510
and persist to protect
against subsequent infection

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.380
in the future.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:46.080
If you look at antibody
responses in people

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.992
who were hospitalized
as same cohort,

00:24:47.992 --> 00:24:49.950
you can see that they
come up slowly over time,

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.290
and within about three
weeks, almost everybody

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:54.540
has antibodies.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:58.830
So they're-- sorry--

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:04.260
so we have ways to now
really track the infection,

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.450
figure out who's infected.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:08.460
And this is-- these
antibody tests

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.495
are going to be a really
important epidemiologic tool.

00:25:11.495 --> 00:25:12.870
Well, let's go on
and talk about,

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:16.730
what are the prospects
for treatment?

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:20.490
There, basically, are
two approaches that

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:21.930
in general are being pursued.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:26.040
One is antiviral therapies
that directly attack the virus,

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.017
and an example of
this is Remdesivir.

00:25:29.017 --> 00:25:30.600
Remember, in the
beginning, I told you

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.810
Diana Brainard was getting
calls in South Africa

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:37.470
to release a drug that had
been developed for Ebola.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:39.900
That drug was
Remdesivir, and it's now

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.650
been shown to have some effect.

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:46.680
Now, the important thing to
note from this paper that

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.510
was published in The
New England Journal

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:53.190
is that, although Remdesivir
does have an effect in speeding

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:56.940
the time to recovery, there's
no change in mortality that's

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.110
statistically significant.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.680
So it's really a
marginal benefit,

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.140
and it has to be
given intravenously.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.360
We need drugs that
can be given orally,

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.090
that can be given early
in the onset of disease,

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.830
and/or in later disease,
and have an effect.

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.310
It probably makes
a big difference

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.770
when drugs are given in
terms of their ability

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.220
to make an effect, and
I'll come back to that.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:24.220
Another approach is to use
neutralizing SARS-CoV-2

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.930
antibodies, and these can come
from convalescent plasma, which

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.660
has been given an
emergency use authorization

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.900
and has been a subject of much
controversy as to whether it

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.420
really works.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:40.170
Another therapy on the horizon
is monoclonal antibodies

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.530
that are able to neutralize
the virus that could be given

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:47.040
prophylactically or
potentially therapeutically,

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.340
but those are not yet licensed.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:54.810
Another way to approach therapy
is to have directed therapies

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.760
to block the cytokine storm.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.310
So these are
host-directed therapies,

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.830
such as antibodies
to interleukin 6,

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:02.880
which is elevated.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.780
It's a pro-inflammatory
cytokine and helps

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.050
to create this cytokine storm.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:14.400
And another is
dexamethasone, a steroid.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.600
Dexamethasone has been
shown to have some effect

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.310
and is now being used, but there
are lots and lots of trials

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:26.490
that are underway and
still no clear front

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:32.130
runner of a drug that truly
meets the requirements,

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:36.180
I think, to have an impact of
being readily available, orally

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.780
ingestible, rapidly
acting, and active

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.930
during all phases of infection.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:47.700
So let me move on now to
talk a little bit about what

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:52.560
the prospects for vaccines
are, which is really

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.960
what I think it's going
to take for us to get out

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.960
of this pandemic.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.510
Again, a basic concept
to make sure that we're--

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.780
or basic concepts to
make sure that we're all

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.910
on the same page.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:08.980
Immunity is protection
from an infectious disease.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.310
If you're immune
to a disease, you

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.460
can be exposed to it
without becoming infected,

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:18.030
or you can have a very
attenuated infection, such

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:21.960
that you don't even notice
that you've been infected.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.840
Immunity can be induced by at
least two different mechanisms.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.190
One is infection itself,
and that, hopefully,

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:32.070
leads to immunity to
any subsequent encounter

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:36.150
by generating, for example,
antibodies that persist.

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:38.340
Another is by
immunization, which

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.590
is the giving of
a vaccine product

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:43.410
that stimulates a person's
immune system to produce

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:46.530
immunity to a specific
disease, protecting

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:47.890
that person from disease.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:52.020
So in other words, you're
training the immune system

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:56.490
to attack the virus,
without the person ever

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:58.500
having seen the
virus, by giving just

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.940
a portion of the
virus in a vaccine

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.600
and using that as
your training vehicle.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:12.420
So right now, there are
probably close to 200 vaccines

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.760
in development.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.790
In terms of where we
are in human trials,

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.910
there is a plethora of
vaccines that have already

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.880
entered human trials.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.440
23 vaccines are
in phase 1, which

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.770
is the first phase of study,
where you test whether vaccines

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:32.160
are safe, and you determine
what sort of dosage

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.930
can be tolerated.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.630
Phase 2, there are
now 14 vaccines

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:43.680
in that stage, which is an
expansion of the phase 1 trial

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.400
to get more safety information
and learn something

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.560
about immunogenicity.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.660
Phase 3 trials, of
which there are nine,

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:55.110
is when large efficacy
trials are begun.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:59.430
I think you've all
heard that the goal is

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:03.450
to determine efficacy of a
vaccine as quickly as possible,

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.640
and the way that
that will be done

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.330
is by dramatically increasing
the number of individuals

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:11.470
that receive the vaccine.

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.220
So the trials that are planned
are somewhere between 30,000

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:18.300
and 50,000 patients
because you have

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.550
to have enough
infections occurring

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:26.400
to show that the vaccine
works better than the placebo.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.930
Finally, there
are three vaccines

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.120
that have been approved
for earlier limited use,

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.570
not by the FDA, but
by other countries,

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:36.690
China and Russia in particular,
but there are no vaccines

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:38.880
yet approved for full use.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.360
There are four different
general categories of vaccine

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.380
that are being pursued.

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.660
One is genetic vaccines.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.700
The Moderna vaccine here
in Boston is one of those.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.730
They're based on messenger RNA.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:52.770
DNA is another form.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:56.250
These used one or more genes to
stimulate an immune response,

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:59.070
genes from SARS-CoV-2.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:01.350
Inactivated viral vectors
is another approach

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:04.290
that's in part being done
here in Boston by Dan

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:08.160
Barouch in collaboration
with Janssen

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:12.940
and also by AstraZeneca in
collaboration with Oxford.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.800
This is the use of
another virus to deliver

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:21.630
SARS-CoV-2 genes to cells to
stimulate an immune response.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.300
A more standard approach
that's been used for years

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.220
is viral protein plus adjuvant.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.050
This is a little further
behind in the pipeline,

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.470
but it uses SARS-CoV-2
protein or protein

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:35.220
fragment, along with
something to help stimulate

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:38.820
the local milieu
where the injection is

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:42.640
made in order to stimulate
an immune response.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.210
And finally,
inactivated SARS-CoV-2,

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.900
which is just inactivation
of full virus, which

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.330
has also been used
in the past and is

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:54.360
what the Chinese
have already started

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.950
using in some circumstances.

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.620
Let me tell you a
little bit about what

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:02.550
we know from the work that
we've done here in Boston.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:05.302
This has been led
by Dan Barouch, one

00:32:05.302 --> 00:32:07.260
of the founding members
of the Ragon Institute,

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.990
who is also a
physician-scientist

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:15.150
and at the Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.560
As soon as the virus
sequence was released,

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:23.640
Dan ordered synthetic genes,
started vaccine design built

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.386
on a collaboration already
existing with Janssen, Johnson

00:32:27.386 --> 00:32:32.250
&amp; Johnson, by the end of
January to work together,

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:36.480
then tested the vaccines
in animals during February,

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:41.550
established a challenge stock,
and by the end of March already

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:47.460
had data suggesting that this
was immunogenic in monkeys.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.520
And Janssen made the
decision to go forward

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:55.170
with making, scaling
up production

00:32:55.170 --> 00:33:01.140
in case the subsequent studies
would show that the vaccine was

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.830
safe and effective.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:06.810
The first human studies are
going to be done in this month,

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:09.530
and the expectation
is by early 2021

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:12.330
there'll be massive
scale-up and emergency use

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:15.330
authorization for the vaccine.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:16.800
Here are the data in monkeys.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.780
On the left, sham vaccination.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.570
Red is the composite
for 10 animals.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:24.660
You can see that there
is a marked increase

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:33.570
in virus, and in this case,
following vaccination and then

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:34.402
challenge.

00:33:34.402 --> 00:33:36.360
But on the right, you
see the marked difference

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:43.410
using the spike protein
as a vaccine antigen.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.540
And of the four animals
that were in this,

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:49.410
two of them actually never had
a blip in virus, and two of them

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:54.730
had a markedly attenuated level
of virus in the bloodstream.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:58.830
So the goal here
is that, instead

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:01.290
of what happens with
infection where you generate

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:03.960
an antibody response,
what will happen here

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.510
is that through vaccination
you'll generate antibodies.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:09.780
And then if the
person then encounters

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.409
virus, what will happen is
either minimal infection

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:16.830
or, in fact, no
infection related

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:20.760
to a massive increase
in antibodies

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:26.230
when they encounter the
true virus infection.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:28.800
So how are we going to know
if a vaccine is effective?

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.570
Well, we have to
test it in a place

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:32.460
where there's a lot
of transmission,

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.380
and, sadly, in the
world there's still

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:38.429
a lot of transmission occurring,
most of it in Asia, but also

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:41.940
in South America,
and North America,

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.710
and rising numbers in Europe.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:45.420
In The New York Times
on the front page

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.409
this morning was an article
about concern in Spain

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:53.429
that there's a
recrudescence of new cases.

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:57.720
South Africa has had a major
spike, but that has dwindled,

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:02.250
but it's with extensive
curtailment of activities.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:06.660
Also, we know, as shown in The
New York Times vaccine tracker,

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:10.490
that we're seeing lots
of cases of infection

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:12.390
that are being detected
in colleges, which

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:16.830
may be another place to test a
vaccine, although many of these

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:22.620
are actually going more
to online education.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.175
So as we move
forward, we're going

00:35:24.175 --> 00:35:26.130
to have to ultimately
prioritize and decide,

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:29.440
what are the vaccines that
we really want to take?

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.620
And what do we really
want to promote

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.860
to make 7 billion doses
to be able to make it

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.030
available for the entire world?

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:40.150
The one question is, will the
vaccine protect from infection

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:43.950
or does it just
protect from disease?

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:47.160
And, ideally, we'd like to
have a vaccine that completely

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.210
protects from infection.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:51.210
That would be an
antibody-based vaccine

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.600
to get free virus before
it can infect cells,

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.060
but even something that
protects from disease

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:01.560
and keeps virus slow enough
that people won't transmit

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.220
would be extremely
beneficial, and that

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.410
would likely depend on T cells.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.270
How many doses are
needed for protection?

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.640
Well, if you need three
doses given over six months

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.580
to get to protection,
that means that a vaccine

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.580
available to be
given in December

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:21.630
won't actually protect
people until next June.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:24.420
Will there be enough new
infections to show it protects?

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.490
I've just gone over that.

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.070
How soon can the
vaccine be available?

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:35.190
And here, I think, one has to be
aware of when the first vaccine

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:40.800
is in a vial and can be
given to a person versus when

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.780
that vaccine is
available worldwide,

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.360
and you go into your
doctor's office,

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.490
and he's got it on a
shelf, or her shelf,

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:52.080
and can pull it off
and give it to you.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.460
And so that's going to
require massive scale-up,

00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:00.390
and I think all of us hope that
multiple vaccines will actually

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:04.140
make it to the finish
line because none of these

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:08.920
is going to easily make it to
the level of 7 billion doses.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.480
For the vaccine that Dan
Barouch is making with the Ragon

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.010
Institute and the BIDMC,
they have committed

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.520
to making a billion doses.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:25.230
So the next topic is kind of
enough of the vaccine be made.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.210
It's going to be
challenging, but people

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:29.630
are scaling that up right now.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:33.150
A critically important
question is, does the vaccine

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.130
work regardless of age?

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:37.230
Most of the vaccine
trials are not

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:39.180
including people
that are much older.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.460
The few that have
in humans have shown

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:45.270
that people that are most
susceptible in terms of age

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:49.680
are less likely to make an
immune response to the vaccine

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.420
vectors that they've been given.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:55.150
Another critical question is
whether a vaccine requires

00:37:55.150 --> 00:38:00.100
a "cold chain," and
this is really critical

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.270
when one thinks about
global delivery.

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:05.130
If you have to keep
the vaccine on dry ice,

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:08.530
and you have to deliver it
to rural areas in Africa--

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:12.430
moreover, if you have to
aliquot the vaccine once you

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:17.080
get to the community that you're
trying to administer it in,

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:22.990
that requires special facilities
and special measures that

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:25.300
will make it much, much
more difficult. So,

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.810
ideally, we want no
"cold chain" requirement.

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:31.570
How durable is the immunity
the vaccine induces?

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:34.960
Well, there already have
been some suggestions

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.940
of reinfection of people that
have already been infected.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:42.796
Shiv Pallai's work suggests that
the antibodies being produced

00:38:42.796 --> 00:38:51.340
are not normal in
that the lymph nodes

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.600
themselves are not normal.

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:57.700
They don't generate
germinal centers.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:05.600
So I think, personally, I
think the word is still out.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.030
It's still unclear whether
these immune responses that

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:11.530
are generated by
natural immunity

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:16.480
actually do provide long-term
protection, and time will tell.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.540
Another critical question is,
do vaccine-induced antibodies

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.400
enhance infection?

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.320
Or is it possible
even that they may

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.795
contribute to multifocal
inflammatory syndrome

00:39:25.795 --> 00:39:27.620
in children?

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.310
And another thing
that's not on this slide

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:36.190
is that, in fact, children, or
people less than 18 years old,

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:39.610
is a whole other category
of individuals that,

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:41.560
appropriately, are
not being tested right

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.170
now in the first wave
of these vaccines,

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:46.510
as we're looking for safety.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:50.050
But when they when
the trials are

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:54.290
done in people that are 18 to
65 years old, the question is,

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:57.670
will there need to be a
whole separate set of studies

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:02.200
done in children in order
to get licensure to give

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:06.550
these things to children to know
that they're safe in children?

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:10.000
So this is a really
important point

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.020
that I don't think has been
given enough attention.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:18.430
At least, it's not
clear from what

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:20.770
I've read what the
actual plans are

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:27.310
for development and licensure
of these vaccines for children.

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:31.280
So I think, while we're
waiting for a vaccine,

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.400
we have to ask what
else can we do.

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.840
We, in the Boston
and Cambridge area,

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.260
I think, as a group of
scientists recognized that this

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.840
was going to be a really
challenging problem,

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.450
and we felt we had
something to contribute.

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:49.600
In fact, we felt we had
something to contribute

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.110
on a grander scale if we could
get everybody collaborating

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:53.650
together.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:59.110
So on March 3, I had, I
think, what for all of us

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:03.310
was a really unique experience,
where we got together

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:10.120
with about 85 scientists from
Harvard, MIT, UMass, Tufts,

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.000
and Boston University
to talk about what

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.720
we as a scientific
community could do,

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.510
and a clinical community could
do, to address this pandemic.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.880
And what came out of that
was the establishment

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.790
of the Massachusetts Consortium
on Pathogen Readiness,

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:29.050
Mass CPR, which has been
an extraordinary experience

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:30.280
for all of us involved.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.340
I've never seen the
kind of collaboration

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:38.680
that has evolved
from this consortium.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.390
We have six different
working groups

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:44.410
in areas ranging from clinical
and outcomes research,

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:48.460
to diagnostics, to
therapeutics, to pathogenesis,

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:56.350
and to vaccines and
epidemiology, and a huge amount

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:59.470
of collaboration and sharing
that's been happening.

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:01.570
We've also been
closely collaborating

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:08.440
with investigators in China
who are at the Guangzhou

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.020
Institute for Respiratory
Health, which has

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.570
been a fabulous collaboration.

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:19.060
And I'm really optimistic, given
the number of people working

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:23.770
on this problem, and the
selflessness with which people

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:27.460
have been working,
that we will make

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.660
real progress going forward.

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:33.490
And I think we already have
seen extraordinary progress up

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:35.110
to this point.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.930
I think the other thing that we
can do is follow the science.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:43.510
We know how transmission occurs,
and there's been a lot of talk

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.930
about droplets versus
aerosols and how long they

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:49.250
stay in the air, et cetera.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:51.760
But I think the critical
experiment has really

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.660
been done, and the
fact of the matter

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:57.230
is we know how to
prevent transmission.

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:00.800
And that experiment was
done in the hospitals, where

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.800
masks were worn by everybody.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.340
Distancing couldn't
actually be achieved,

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.860
but hand washing could,
and what we did not see

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.690
was major outbreaks among
health care workers.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.380
In fact, at Mass
General, the incidence

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.970
of infection among
health care workers

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:19.260
is less than in the community.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:22.820
I think that shows
us that masks work,

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:31.070
and I think, while we're all
working as vigorously as we can

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:33.980
to come up with solutions
in terms of therapeutics

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:37.100
and vaccines, if
we wear our masks,

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:41.310
we will prevent
transmissions from happening.

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:43.490
So let me make a
few conclusions.

00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:45.560
One is that advances
in other fields

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:49.130
have clearly accelerated
responses to COVID-19.

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:51.770
Everything that we've done
at the Ragon Institute

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:55.910
has been based on things that
we learned from working on HIV,

00:43:55.910 --> 00:44:02.450
including the entire
backbone for Dan's vaccine.

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:04.490
SARS-CoV-2 infection
is transmitted

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:07.460
prior to symptoms, which is
how it's spread so rapidly

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.730
and why it's so important
that everybody wear masks.

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:13.610
Infection results in a
hyperinflammatory state,

00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:18.290
involving multiple organs,
and that is what makes,

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:21.950
what we think contributes to
a lot of the pathogenesis.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:24.950
There are currently no
highly-effective treatments,

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:29.510
even though there are some
that have marginal impact,

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:33.520
but we really need better drugs.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.660
And while we're
waiting for a vaccine,

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:37.520
effective prevention
can be achieved

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:41.030
with masks, physical
distancing, and hand washing.

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:44.670
There has been unprecedented
progress toward a vaccine.

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:48.800
We have to be sure that that
vaccine is safe and effective

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.730
by the time we actually
administer it more broadly.

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:55.130
And, clearly, there's
still much to be

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:57.950
done and much that people--

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:01.010
no matter what your discipline
is among the students that

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:05.400
are listening to this talk,
it intersects with a pandemic,

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:10.280
whether it be in the scientific
realm, the psychological realm,

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:16.950
the therapeutic realm, the
economic realm, et cetera.

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:22.350
So we can all contribute
to a solution.

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:25.310
And with that, I will thank
you for your attention,

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:30.520
and I'm happy to
answer some questions

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:32.920
RICHARD YOUNG: Bruce,
thank you so much.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:36.560
The students have a
number of questions.

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:40.210
One is asking you,
why do you think

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:43.358
the US is among the most
highly-infected nations

00:45:43.358 --> 00:45:43.900
in the world?

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:52.310
BRUCE WALKER: Well, I
think that you can actually

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:55.190
see that in the
tracings that I showed,

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:58.460
in the last month or so,
the number of infections

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:01.220
have come down in
the US, and that

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:06.290
is directly correlated with
increased adherence to the use

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:09.140
of masks and social distancing.

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.720
Other countries implemented
those measures right away.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.900
They did complete lockdowns
like we did, but came back

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:21.140
from the lockdowns with
continued, really vigorous

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:24.470
adherence to the
prevention measures that

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:26.600
were available to us.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:33.240
And it's not really a surprise
that masks would be important.

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.660
In fact, it's important
you wear a mask so

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.600
that you protect other people.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.190
I don't think
anybody on this call

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:45.260
would want to have open heart
surgery with their physician,

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:51.050
surgeon, and OR nurse
not wearing masks.

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:52.550
They don't wear
them because they're

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.010
afraid of getting some
infection from the patient.

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:58.320
They're wearing them to
prevent infecting the patient.

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:02.030
We know that masks
can do that, and so I

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:07.250
think that's a
critical factor here,

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:10.670
and one of the unknowns for
the future as to whether people

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:15.470
will really adhere to
that and whether people

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:19.490
will understand
that there are times

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:25.280
when we need to limit our own
freedoms in order to protect

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.350
the population at large.

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:30.650
And there are lots of
examples of decisions

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:34.280
that we as a society
make to do just that,

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:38.150
and I think this is a situation
where we need to do the same.

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:39.680
RICHARD YOUNG: And
Tara is asking,

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:44.870
about how long active
recovery from infection

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:48.770
does the antibody test
results remain positive?

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:51.710
BRUCE WALKER: So this is a
really critical and unanswered

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:54.320
question as yet.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:48:00.470
So we only know as long as
the epidemic has been around,

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:04.280
and there is evidence
that in some people

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.510
antibody levels are declining
to become undetectable

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:11.850
over a fairly short
period of time.

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:16.130
There is concern I alluded
to for at least four cases

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:19.340
of reported reinfection of
people that have already

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:23.870
been infected, presumably
because antibodies, which we

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:27.320
have very good evidence that
the antibodies can be protective

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:31.340
if they're there, but these
people have gotten reinfected.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.960
We don't know their
antibody levels

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:36.050
to really know how
that correlated,

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:38.630
but that's a really big concern.

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:41.390
And, obviously, that
would have a big impact

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:44.010
for the development
of herd immunity,

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:49.660
which is when enough people have
immunity that others won't--

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:53.077
that the virus can't easily
transmit through a population

00:48:53.077 --> 00:48:54.410
because it doesn't have enough--

00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:56.910
there aren't enough
susceptible hosts.

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:59.230
Now, the question that was
asked was about somebody

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:00.350
who becomes infected.

00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:02.690
How long do those
antibodies last?

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:06.230
Now, I think the data
that Shiv has generated

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:08.750
suggests why they
may not last long,

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:10.550
but what about immunization?

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:12.680
Well, how long will
those antibodies last?

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.750
And that's something
else we don't know,

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:18.320
but my sense is that that's
likely to last longer because

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:22.070
rather than trying to generate
an antibody response in a lymph

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:27.090
node that's infected with
live virus, in this case,

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:31.010
you're taking a
fragment of virus,

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:33.830
delivering it to a lymph
node, and the lymph node's

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:35.450
learning how to--

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:37.760
teaching the immune
response to recognize it

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:41.780
without being impaired by the
ongoing virus replication.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.240
So I think that those
are likely to be

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:49.690
two very different things,
but time will tell.

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:51.350
RICHARD YOUNG: Lena
is asking if you

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:54.560
can comment on the
mutability of SARS-CoV-2

00:49:54.560 --> 00:50:00.890
and the impact of emerging
mutations on our plans

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:02.570
to vaccinate.

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:05.270
BRUCE WALKER: Yeah, this is
another really good question.

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:13.730
So SARS-CoV-2 is
nothing like HIV, which

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:15.920
mutates at an incredible rate.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:22.310
In fact, if I compare an HIV
virus sequence from Boston

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:24.710
to one in South
Africa, they may be

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:30.260
40% different in the
envelope, so we've never

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.990
dealt with trying to make a
vaccine to a pathogen that

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.860
diverse.

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:38.780
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2
has very few mutations.

00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:43.020
It does mutate,
and the consequence

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.360
of those mutations
on immune recognition

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:49.530
are still being sorted
out, but there is concern.

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:53.640
And, clearly, the
whole population,

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:57.150
the global population
of SARS has already

00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:00.570
shifted to some extent, and
I know that Dan has already

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:04.140
made another vaccine with
a second strain of SARS

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:05.740
just in case.

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:10.180
What will be critical is whether
the mutations that arise,

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:15.540
albeit we expect them to be
far, far less than with HIV,

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:19.560
whether those will actually
result in immune escape.

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:24.420
And, again, this
is a reason why we

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:29.280
need to do lots of sequencing
and lots of surveillance

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:34.080
to keep ahead of
this, and it may

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.890
be that, like other
infections like influenza,

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:43.620
there is a requirement
for updating vaccines

00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:46.160
on a regular basis.

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:50.150
RICHARD YOUNG: Another student's
asking for the genetic vaccine,

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:53.750
or vaccines using inactivated
viral vectors, what

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:57.772
are the concerns of long-term
effects of the vectors

00:51:57.772 --> 00:52:00.380
or delivery methods?

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:04.310
BRUCE WALKER: So with
the genetic vaccines,

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:07.730
there's less experience
with those, and so

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:09.950
the clinical trials
that are ongoing now,

00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:13.020
both for other
diseases-- for example,

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:17.690
Moderna has other pathogens that
they've developed vaccines for,

00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:21.020
so they have more
human data from those.

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:24.240
DNA vaccines, likewise, have
been used for other pathogens,

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.920
so that data have
been generated.

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.075
In terms of inactivated viruses,
we've used those for years.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:39.080
You can ask, why didn't we
do that approach with HIV?

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:42.050
In fact, in the monkey
model, it looked

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:44.210
like an inactivated
virus worked,

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:48.200
but the concern is just
whether the virus could somehow

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.840
become reactivated
and become infectious.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.450
And I think that's
tempered enthusiasm

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:57.140
for inactivated
vaccines, but there

00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:02.720
are, I think, ways to make
an inactivated vaccine safe,

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.760
but that's the main concern.

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:10.730
Another concern is that it's
more laborious and expensive

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:13.670
to make inactivated vaccines
because you have to grow up

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:16.520
a huge amount of virus
in order to do that,

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:21.710
and these entirely synthetic
approaches that can be used,

00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:29.420
like with mRNA, are potentially
a real plus if we can do that

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.780
without having to
rely on cell culture

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:36.590
and other aspects that
are required for the more

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:38.780
traditional approaches.

00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:40.530
RICHARD YOUNG: Many
students had questions

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:43.980
about reinfection
and the possibility

00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:48.990
that reinfection is a
consequence of the antibodies

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:52.050
just not doing what
they need to do.

00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:55.140
Do you have a view
on reinfection,

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:59.940
the extent to which it
happens and the implications?

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.990
BRUCE WALKER: And
there's another concern

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:05.912
about reinfection
based on dengue virus,

00:54:05.912 --> 00:54:08.370
and that is where the antibodies
could actually make things

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:11.070
worse the second time around.

00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:13.440
One of these cases
of reinfection,

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:16.650
not to alarm people, did
look like it was worse

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:18.990
the second time around,
but so far, there's

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:23.070
no evidence from the
earlier SARS data

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:26.580
that I think are compelling.

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:28.570
There's no evidence
to suggest that there

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:32.160
is this phenomenon of
antibody-dependent enhancement.

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:35.430
I think, in terms of
protecting from infection,

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:37.145
antibodies are going to--

00:54:37.145 --> 00:54:38.520
neutralizing
antibodies are going

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.490
to be required to do
that, from reinfection.

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:45.030
So not everybody generates
sufficient levels

00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:46.590
of neutralizing
antibodies, probably,

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:49.650
from their first infection.

00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:52.620
I think, though,
that T cells may also

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:55.920
play a really big role
in cases of reinfection

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.550
because if the virus slips
through the first defense

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:02.250
of antibodies and
gets into cells,

00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:06.000
then T cells are the
main effector mechanism

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.370
that can eliminate virus.

00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:14.130
And so I think
attention to vaccines

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:18.270
that not only produce antibodies
but also produce T cells

00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:19.470
is important.

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:24.780
Moreover, there's a
second kind of T cell

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:26.070
besides the killer cell.

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:29.250
Those are helper cells
that help to orchestrate

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:32.850
an effective antibody response
in those germinal centers,

00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:40.950
and so generating COVID-specific
T helper cell responses,

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:43.420
I think, may also
be really important,

00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:50.270
particularly for the prospect
of potential reinfection.

00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:53.800
RICHARD YOUNG: Bruce, we so
appreciate you giving this,

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:59.750
an introduction to the disease,
the virus, the pandemic.

00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:03.738
Thank you very much, and we'll
see all of you again next week.

00:56:03.738 --> 00:56:05.030
BRUCE WALKER: Thanks very much.

00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:06.970
I enjoyed it.
